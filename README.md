<h1>ü¶Ö Advanced Sniper Bot Smart Contract ü¶Ö</h1>

Welcome to the Advanced Sniper Bot Smart Contract‚Äîan intelligent and cutting-edge trading bot designed for precision and profitability in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi). This contract leverages Chainlink's robust data feeds and AI-powered predictions to make swift, data-driven decisions in real-time, allowing you to capitalize on market inefficiencies across multiple DEXes.


<h1>üåü Key Features</h1>

    AI-Enhanced Decision Making: This bot integrates with AI-based oracle data to evaluate market conditions, optimize trade execution, and manage risks dynamically.

    Multi-DEX Arbitrage Capabilities: The bot is designed to interact with multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities for maximum gains.

    Dynamic Gas Management: Advanced gas optimization ensures that trades are executed only when gas fees are within a user-defined limit, protecting your profits from being eroded by high gas costs.

    Risk Management and Security: Features like blacklist management, price slippage limits, and token validation add extra layers of security and risk management.

    Comprehensive Analytics: Record and analyze every trade with detailed logs, making it easy to fine-tune trading strategies and improve performance over time.

<h1> üöÄ How It Works </h1>

The Advanced Sniper Bot is built using Solidity and integrates with Chainlink oracles to obtain real-time data on ETH prices and AI-based market predictions. The bot uses this data to decide whether to enter a trade, how much to trade, and on which DEX to execute the trade. Below is an overview of the contract‚Äôs core components:
Modules

    Core Trading Module:
        Contains the core logic for executing trades on various DEXes like Uniswap, SushiSwap, etc.
        Optimizes trade size and slippage based on real-time market conditions.

    Chainlink Integration Module:
        Integrates with Chainlink oracles to fetch ETH/USD prices and AI-based predictions.
        Uses these predictions to make data-driven decisions about market entry.

    Risk Management Module:
        Implements a blacklist for unwanted tokens or risky addresses.
        Manages gas price and slippage limits to protect against adverse market conditions.

    Analytics Module:
        Records detailed data on every trade, including token pairs, trade amounts, gas prices, and timestamps.
        Provides functions to retrieve trade history and the last trade executed.

<h1>‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation </h1>

To set up and deploy this bot, follow the steps below:
Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm installed
    Truffle or Hardhat development environment
    MetaMask or other Ethereum wallet
    Chainlink contracts installed

Step-by-Step Guide

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/NeuroGhostOutput/OneTapBot.git
cd advanced-sniper-bot

Install Dependencies:

bash

npm install

Configure Environment:

    Update the truffle-config.js or hardhat.config.js with your network and wallet information.

Deploy Contracts:

bash

truffle migrate --network mainnet

# or for Hardhat

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet

Set Chainlink Oracle Addresses:

    Update the contract with the appropriate Chainlink Price Feed addresses for your network (Mainnet, Rinkeby, Kovan, etc.).

Test the Contract:

bash

    truffle test
    # or for Hardhat
    npx hardhat test

<h1>üìä Usage</h1>

Once deployed, you can interact with the bot via web3.js, ethers.js, or any Ethereum-compatible wallet:
Fetching the Latest ETH Price:

javascript

const ethPrice = await strategyModule.methods.getETHPrice().call();
console.log("Current ETH Price in USD:", ethPrice);

Evaluating a Trade Entry:

javascript

const [shouldEnter, adjustedAmount, maxGasPrice] = await strategyModule.methods.evaluateEntry(token, amount, ethAmount).call();
if (shouldEnter) {
console.log("Conditions met. Executing trade with adjusted amount:", adjustedAmount);
}

Getting Trade History:

javascript

const tradeHistory = await strategyModule.methods.getTradeHistory().call();
console.log("Trade History:", tradeHistory);

<h1>üìú Chainlink Integration </h1>

This bot relies heavily on Chainlink‚Äôs decentralized oracle network for secure and reliable data feeds. Here‚Äôs how it uses Chainlink:

    Price Feeds: Retrieves the latest ETH/USD price to evaluate market conditions.
    AI Predictions: Fetches data from a custom Chainlink oracle that provides AI-based market predictions.

To set up these oracles, visit the official Chainlink Documentation for detailed instructions on deploying your own nodes and aggregators.
<h1>üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations</h1>

    Gas Optimization: Ensure that the bot does not execute trades when gas prices are excessively high.
    Token Whitelist/Blacklist: Implement controls to filter out risky or unwanted tokens.
    Regular Audits: Periodically audit the smart contract code for vulnerabilities.
